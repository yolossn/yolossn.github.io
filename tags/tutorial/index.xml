      <description>Hey pals, Recently I have been dabbling with Arrays in C++ and many times felt Python has better inbuilt list functions than CPP.If you have felt the same way then this post might change it.After extensive searching in the internet I found out that most of the list functions available in python can be acheived in CPP by using the Vector and Algorithm header files properly.
Here I am sharing few of the CPP versions of commonly used Python List funcitons.</description>
